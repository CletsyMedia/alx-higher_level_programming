# Python 🐍 Inheritance

In Python, inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows you to create a new class (a subclass or child class) by deriving properties and behaviors from an existing class (a superclass or parent class). Inheritance promotes code reusability and the creation of a hierarchical structure of classes.

Inheritance is used to create a new class that inherits attributes and methods from an existing class. In Python, a subclass can inherit properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) from a superclass. The subclass can then add additional attributes or methods or override the ones inherited.
